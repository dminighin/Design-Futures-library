## STEEP analysis
A STEEP analysis is a tool used in design futuring to prompt discussion and flesh out various societal factors in our future scenario. This tool is often used by business or organisations to consider a variety of external forces beyond our personal experiences and value systems.

## ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING
Scanning is the ongoing, year-round process of looking for trends and events in the external environment that may have implications for the organization. (…) It may lead to discovery of issues that the analyst can proactively bring to the attention of the organization, or it may provide information that will later prove useful to a particular foresight activity.
(Hines & Bishop, 2015)

## HORIZON SCANNING
Horizon Scanning is a structured and continuous process of reviewing and analyzing current literature, Web sites, and other media aimed to monitor, analyze and position frontier issues that are relevant for policy, research and strategic agendas. The types of issues mapped by Horizon Scanning include new/emerging: trends, policies, practices, stakeholders, services, products, technologies, behaviors, attitudes, surprises (Wild Cards) and seeds of change (Weak Signals).

## CROSS LEVEL ANALYSIS
A four quadrant framework which shows the relationships of the interior and exterior of the individual and the collective. The four quadrants may be conceived of as four aspects of any entity, the upper half corresponding to its individuality (‘agency’), the lower half to its ‘communion’ with the collective. (…)
The upper right quadrant deals with the objectively measurable aspects or behaviours of single individuals, and is thereby termed behavioural. The lower right deals with communities or societies of these individuals and their external interactions, and so is termed social. Technological, economic, political and social systems are found here, so this is where much of STEEP analysis takes place.
While the right hand side is the arena of objective measurement, the left-hand side is the realm of subjective awareness. The upper-left quadrant deals with the interior of the individual; that is, with individual subjective awareness. This is where we experience our hopes, joys, dreams, cognitive capacities and intentions. It is thus termed intentional. When individuals exchange their beliefs and experiences with others, a shared awareness, worldview or culture is established, so the lower left quadrant is termed the cultural.
(Voros, 2001)

## CAUSAL LAYERED ANALYSIS / CLA
Causal layered analysis is based on the assumption that the way in which one frames a problem changes the policy solution and the actors responsible for creating transformation. (…)
The first level is the ‘litany’ – quantitative trends, problems, often exaggerated, often used for political purposes (overpopulation, for example) – usually presented by the news media. (…)The litany level is the most visible and obvious, requiring few analytic capabilities. It is believed, rarely questioned.
The second level is concerned with social causes, including economic, cultural, political and historical factors (rising birthrates, lack of family planning, for example). Interpretation is given to quantitative data. (…) This level excels at technical explanations as well as academic analysis. The role of the state and other actors and interests is often explored at this level. While the data is often questioned, the language of questioning does not contest the paradigm in which the issue is framed. It remains obedient to it.
The third, deeper level is concerned with structure and the discourse/worldview that supports and legitimates it (population growth and civilizational perspectives of family; lack of women’s power; lack of social security, the population/ consumption debate, for example). The task is to find deeper social, linguistic, and cultural structures that are actor­invariant (not dependent on who the actors are). (…)
The fourth layer of analysis is at the level of metaphor or myth. These are the deep stories, the collective archetypes, the unconscious, often emotive, dimensions of the problem or the paradox (seeing population as non­statistical, as community, or seeing people as creative resources, for example). This level provides a gut/emotional level experience to the worldview under inquiry. The language used is less specific, more concerned with evoking visual images, with touching the heart instead of reading the head. This is the root level of questioning. However, questioning itself finds its limits since the frame of questioning must enter other frameworks of understanding—the mythical, for example. (…)
CLA however, does not privilege a particular level. Moving up and down layers we can integrate analysis and synthesis, and horizontally we can integrate discourses, ways of knowing and worldviews, thereby increasing the richness of the analysis.

## REFRAMING
The notion of reframing recognizes that those stories already lodged in people’s subconscious are powerful, and that we need to have equally powerful new stories to gain people’s attention. To move people to new thinking, we need to supply new stories–ones that are compelling enough and make strong enough connections to people’s worldviews, that they succeed against the frames and stories that people already have. (…) That kind of reframing recognizes existing frames and narratives. Rather than use data to argue, reframing offers a story, in this case, a story that says, “It doesn’t have to be unpleasant. You have the power to make it fun!”
(Jarratt&Mahaffie, 2009)

## SCENARIO
Tools for ordering one’s perceptions about alternative future environments in which today’s decisions might be played out… scenarios resemble a set of stories, written or spoken, built around carefully constructed plots… good scenarios are plausible and surprising, they have the power to break old stereotypes, and their creators assume ownership and put them to work. using scenarios is rehearsing the future. by recognizing the warning signs and the drama that is unfolding, one can avoid surprises, adapt and act effectively.
(Schwartz in Zindato, 2016)
—
Scenarios take us into a possible future. They describe a world to come, making a systematic set of assumptions about the drivers shaping that world. They may be brief and descriptive or they may include story-like narratives that represent the point of view of personas in the future. They may include a “history of the future”—how we get from here to there.

## VISIONING
The process of creating a series of images or visions of the future that are real and compelling enough to motivate and guide people toward focusing their efforts on achieving certain goals.
(Cornish, 2005)

## VISUALIZATION
In a design process, qualitative, sensorial and conceptual elements are described on a cognitive level, which is characteristic of design process itself. Therefore it is important to develop visual tools based not on mimetic and analogical mechanisms but on symbolic processes.
In fact, visualization takes places through a symbolic mediation between thinking and communication. (…)
Visualization, being a descriptive and interpretative attitude, establishes itself in the role of a pivotal point in describing the present. It states the passage from a knowledge creation phase to a knowledge transfer phase.
(Colombi,PhD Thesis 2007)

## MOODBOARD
Mood boards are visually stimulating collections of images, artefacts, colour or material trends, used to suggest different design directions. They are tools for inspiration, often used to generate discussion within the project team about issues which are difficult to describe in writing or verbally, such as styles, forms, meanings, emotional qualities, lifestyles or cultural trends.

## PANNELLI DI LIFESTYLE
(…)approfondiscono il contesto materiale di riferimento, descrivendo lo stile di vita del target potenziale che si ispira ai valori dello scenario stesso. Questa tavola traduce l’idea che il prodotto moda, come prodotto industriale, non possa esistere se non in relazione all’utente che lo utilizzerà e al contesto d’uso nel quale la relazione utente-prodotto avrà luogo.
(Colombi, 2010)

## TREND BOOK
Il trend book si riferisce invece più puntualmente a settori merceologici specifici, coprendo tutta la filiera produttiva: a partire da contenuti trasversali, vengono proposti book per prodotti semilavorati (tessuti, pellami, maglieria e stampe), per un particolare settore (abbigliamento prêt à porter, casual, sportivo; intimo e mare; accessori, cosmesi) declinato per una target precisa (donna/uomo/bambino), articolando progressivamente i diversi temi in maniera più particolareggiata. I temi proposti sono generalmente da 5 a 7, in relazione a diversi target e occasioni d’uso, e vengono sviluppati in maniera verticale arrivando sino alla proposta di un prodotto finito, con sketch di alcuni capisaldi per sviluppare il concept di collezione attraverso la definizione dei caratteri tipologici e del linguaggio stilisti coadottato, dei materiali, dei colori, delle stampe, dei dettagli costruttivi e delle finiture.
(Colombi, 2010)

## MINDMAPPING
Mind mapping is a technique applied to brainstorming and other group discussion methods (…). It allows a group’s ideas to be charted in logical groupings fairly quickly, even when ideas are given in a non-sequential manner. This technique allows efficient brainstorming for ideas and at the same time creates a skeletal framework for later categorisation of the information generated.
