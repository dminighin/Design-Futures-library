## Backcasting 
Backcasting is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present. The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the University of Waterloo in 1990. The fundamental question of backcasting asks: "if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?" 

## Curious rituals

"The Curious Ritual are the things which people and organizations are doing now, in our present, but for which we don’t have a shared, common and easy understanding yet. They may be large or small, disruptive or moderate, local or global, fast or slow." Source: nefula.com/methodology

## Diegetic prototyping 
Design objects to shape and define the surrounding scenario and, consequently, its characterising elements. It can be used the other way around as well: defining a scenario using (or designing) its diegetic elements, thus representing a future where the design object (or objective) will be conceived and developed.

## Anticipation 
All efforts to “know the future” in the sense of thinking about and using the future are forms of anticipation. Equally the future is incorporated into all phenomena, conscious or unconscious, physical or ideational, as anticipation. 
The DoA[Discipline of Anticipation] covers all “ways of knowing” the later-than-now as anticipation, from those forms of anticipation that are observed, for instance, in a tree that loses its leaves in the Autumn to human planning that attempts to colonize the future and efforts to make sense of emergent novelty in the present by finding inspiration in systemically discontinuous imaginary futures. Looked at as a “way-of-knowing” the DoAaddresses the codification of the myriad of systems of anticipation, both conscious and non-conscious. The DoA develops, sorts, and diffuses descriptions of the processes/systems of anticipation or how the later-than-now enters into reality.

## Forecasting 
The term forecasting describes a mathematical, extrapolation-based approach to drawing future paths. Forecasting is the process of thinking about the future as an extension of the past and present: a process based on known data, facts, values and behaviour to predict aspects of the future.

## Foresight 
Foresight is a systematic, participatory, prospective, action and policy-oriented process which, with the support of environmental and horizon scanning approaches, is aimed to create and sustain a variety of high-quality forward views and to actively engage stakeholders into a wide range of activities anticipating, recommending and transforming technological, economic, environmental, political, social and ethical futures. It can be envisaged as a triangle combining “Thinking the Future”, “Debating the Future” and “Shaping the Future”. 
(IKnow Project; European Foresight Platform; Hines & Bishop, 2015) 
 
## Future studies 
Futures studies is the systematic study of possible, probable and preferable futures including the worldviews and myths that underlie each future. It is used the plural term “futures” studies rather than the singular “future” studies because this plural form opens up the territory for envisioning and creating alternative and preferred futures. 
The starting point of futures studies grounds on the assumption that future is not predictable nor predestined: Futures studies analyze such facts and phenomena which bear an influence on the future, research alternative paths of development of alternative futures and investigate what kinds of choices lead to the best and most acceptable future state.

## Trends 
Broadly defined as ‘a general direction in which something is developing or changing’, a trend most commonly refers to a ‘manifestation type’ (Miller, 2006) and/or to a mathematical given. The first is build around the gathering of selected signs taken from socially situated contexts. The second, in statistics, stands for the orientation taken by a series of data over a certain period of time. In both cases, the trend takes shape in reference to another trend and cannot exist alone as it participates in a more complex system. During the course of its changing condition, the intensity and duration of the trend can alter and thus be named differently in accordance to its size and nature. 
(Rudkin, 2015) 
— 
Trends are quantities or changes that move incrementally in a specific direction over a long period of time. The capture the value of the quantity and its rate of change (if known). One can always say “more” or “less,” or “increasing” or “decreasing” or even “continuing” when describing a trend. 
(Hines & Bishop, 2015) 
— 
Trends are those change factors that arise from broadly generalizable change and innovation. They are experienced by everyone and often in more or less the same contexts insofar as they create broad parameters for shifts in attitudes, policies and business focus over periods of several years that usually have global reach. 
(Saritas & Smith, 2011) 
— 
What we mean by a trend is something that represents a deeper change, not a fad. If we make an analogy with meteorology, trends would be climate changes rather than variations in the weather. (…) 
Trends are long-term, often irreversible, changes that frequently take place over a number of years and which often creep up imperceptibly. The effect of a strong trend on a phenomenon can often be measured and forecast. (Lindgren &Bandhold, 2003) 

## Weak signal 
Weak signals refer to the early signs of possible but not confirmed changes that may later become more significant indicators of critical forces for development, threats, business and technical innovation. They represent the first signs of paradigm shifts, or future trends, drivers or discontinuities. (Saritas & Smith, 2011)
